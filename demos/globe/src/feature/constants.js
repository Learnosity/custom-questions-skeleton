/**
 * When creating a Learnosity Custom Question, itâ€™s important to prefix the CSS class names being used inside
 * your custom Question UI.
 * You should avoid using a generic class name like `.btn`.
 * Instead, you should add a prefix to it like `.company-name-my-custom-question-btn`
 * to avoid CSS conflict with the host page and the CSS used by the Learnosity API.
